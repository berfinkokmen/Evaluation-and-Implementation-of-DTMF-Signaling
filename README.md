This repo is for the term project of E407 Process Control Laboratory.

## **Overview**  
This project establishes an experiment to observe the functionality of a digital controller in a closed-loop system and to regulate the temperature of the FET transistor within the designed circuit configuration at a specified operating point.

Block diagram of the system is shown below.
